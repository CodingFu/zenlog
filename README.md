# Zenlog - quite simple time logging system for anyone.

## The problem

It's quite important for me to keep track on my daily time spent on different things.
I need a simplistic and reliable instrument, so I write this tiny piece of the software.

## The solution

I will write simple and reliable app for myself that can used pretty much anywhere.

## Description

- First of all, you can add / remove / (maybe) rename some tasks
- Then, you can start working on them by clicking play button.
- Each chunk of time (5 minutes) is stored as you press "Stop" button. If your timer shows 0h 29m 45s, 25 minutes are saved.
- The app can be stored as homescreen app and used offline, synced and updated automatically as soon as you go online.
- It can be deployed to heroku in under 5 minutes.
